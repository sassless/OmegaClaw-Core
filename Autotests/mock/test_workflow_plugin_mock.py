"""
Mock tests for the workflow plugin.

The workflow plugin lets skills be added via MarkDown workflows under
plugins/workflow/instructions/<name>/ (SKILL.md + optional skill.metta). These
tests drive shipped workflows with a mocked LLM, so only the plugin machinery
is exercised: the LLM decision is scripted, the skills run for real inside the
agent and their output is observed on the test comm channel.

  - load + skill: load test-workflow, then run its workflow-only skill
                  test-skill (defined in
                  plugins/workflow/instructions/test-workflow/skill.metta).
                  test-skill is callable only after the workflow is loaded, so
                  its message reaching the channel proves a MarkDown-defined
                  skill is registered and executed.
  - unload:       load test-workflow, unload it, then confirm the
                  workflow-only skill no longer runs.
  - research-workflow: load research-workflow and run its research-start
                  skill; the confirmation on the channel and the project tree
                  written under the memory volume prove a second MarkDown
                  workflow works end to end.
