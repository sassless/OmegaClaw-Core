"""
Test: agent invokes (pin ...) to track multi-step task state.

Per system prompt the agent is taught: "use only pin for task state, and
remember for items that could be valuable in the future". So we give a
multi-step task with an explicit *current step*, and expect a (pin ...)
call that captures the running progress (a step number, the running task
name, or a "done/todo" marker).

We do NOT verify the literal content of the pin — different models pin
different phrasings. We only verify that pin was called in this turn AND
that its argument references either our run-id or a step keyword.

Run:
