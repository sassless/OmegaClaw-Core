"""
Test: agent invokes (episodes ...) to recall history around a timestamp.

Two-turn flow:
  1. Send a uniquely-marked message (seed) and wait for the agent to
     respond — this puts a dated record into history.metta.
  2. After a settle pause, ask the agent to use `episodes` (timestamp
     lookup, NOT query — query is embedding-based) to recall what was
     discussed at that earlier time, and to mention the unique marker.

Pass criteria: an (episodes ...) call in the recall turn AND a (send ...)
that references our seed marker.

Run:
