# Workflow loading plugin

Workflow loading plugin allows loading agent skills written according to the
[common specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). Each workflow
consists of short description, detailed description in `SKILL.md` file and
optionally `skill.metta` file which contains related skills implementation in
MeTTa language.

[Research workflow](./instructions/research-workflow) is a ready-to-use example
of the workflow. One can try it starting the agent and asking it doing a
research on some topic:
```
Start research. Build a classifier for iris dataset using sklearn, compare
logistic regression and random forest.
```

## Workflow files

`description.txt` (required) contains short usually one-line workflow
description for the agent. For example:
```
When user asks to demonstrate workflow plugin load test-workflow instructions: (workflow-load-instructions \"test-workflow\")
```

`SKILL.md` (required) is an agent skills file in the [common
format](https://agentskills.io/specification). For example:
```md
---
name: test-workflow
description: Created to check how SKILL.md is loaded to OmegaClaw.
---
Next are instructions and MeTTa  functions  that should be performed step by step
# Test Workflow (OmegaClaw)
## Step 1 - demonstrate usage of skills
- Call test-skill with "This is a test workflow demonstration" message
## Step 2 - complete workflow
- Call `(workflow-unload-instructions)`
```

`skill.metta` (optional) contains the list of the OmegaClaw skills to load
when workflow is active and additional MeTTa functions which are mentioned in
`SKILL.md` file.

Skill description are added as high-level expressions. Each such expression
adds one skill to the OmegaClaw. First atom of the expression is `skill` symbol
and other atoms are parameters of the `add-skill` function. See
[skills.metta](/src/skills.metta) for details. Skill implementations are
added as MeTTa functions.

For example:
```metta
(skill test-skill "Test skill to demonstrate workflow by sending message to the user" (message_in_quotes))

(= (test-skill $message)
   (send $message))
```

## Using workflow

Start an agent and ask it to use the workflow. For the test workflow above
send: `Demonstrate workflow plugin`

## Workflow parameters

Workflow plugin OmegaClaw configuration parameters:
- `pluginWorkflowInstructionsDir` - path to the directory which contains
  available workflows. Default value is `<project
  root>/plugins/workflow/instructions`
- `pluginWorkflowMemoryDir` - path to the directory to keep workflow working
  files when workflow is active. Default value is
  `<memoryDirectory>/workflow_space`. `memoryDirectory` itself defaults to `./`
  and is set to `$MEMORY_DIR` (`<project root>/memory`) inside the Docker image,
  so the two coincide in Docker and diverge anywhere else.

These parameters are passed as arguments after the image name, which reach the
agent as its command line:
```sh
docker run ... <image> pluginWorkflowInstructionsDir="<path>"
```
The same value can be given as the environment variable
`OMEGACLAW_pluginWorkflowInstructionsDir`, or set in `config/config.yaml`.
`src/config.py` resolves in that order: command line, then environment, then
config file, then the built-in default.
