# Meet Oma

Oma is the first Telegram agent built on the OmegaClaw framework. Interacting
with Oma is the fastest way to experience what we’re building with OmegaClaw.

## Overview

OmegaClaw is a neural-symbolic agent framework built on the Hyperon AGI stack.
It unifies large language models with a formal symbolic layer to create a
stateful cognitive architecture capable of auditable inference, autonomous
self-improvement, and long-term persistence.

Unlike reactive, session-based agents, OmegaClaw operates in a continuous
execution loop, managing its own goals and providing auditable proof trails for
its reasoning.

The primary design criteria for OmegaClaw were simplicity, ease of extension,
and transparent implementation. This results in a minimalist MeTTa-based core
of approximately 200 lines of code.

## Installation

Prerequisites: Git, Python3, Pip and [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) library

Get [SWI-Prolog 9.1.12 or later](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).

Install OmegaClaw:
```
git clone https://github.com/trueagi-io/PeTTa
cd PeTTa
mkdir -p repos
git clone https://github.com/asi-alliance/OmegaClaw-Core.git repos/OmegaClaw-Core
git clone https://github.com/patham9/petta_lib_chromadb.git repos/petta_lib_chromadb
cp repos/OmegaClaw-Core/run.metta ./
```

Setup Python virtual environment (or use your own):
```
python3 -m venv ./.venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```

If you have CPU only machine or don't want calculate embeddings on GPU:
```
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch
```

Install Python dependencies:
```
python3 -m pip install -r ./repos/OmegaClaw-Core/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Before running the system you need to choose your LLM API provider and export the API key as the environment variable.
| Provider | Env var name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Anthropic` (default) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude models via the Anthropic API. |
| `OpenAI` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | GPT models. Also reused by the OpenAI embedding provider below. |
| `ASICloud` | `ASI_API_KEY` |  MiniMax models via ASI Alliance inference endpoint (`inference.asicloud.cudos.org`). |

Run the system via the following command which ensures the system is started from the root folder of PeTTa:
```
OMEGACLAW_AUTH_SECRET=<channel-secret> sh run.sh run.metta IRC_channel="<irc-channel>"
```
After start go to https://webchat.quakenet.org/ to communicate with the agent. Join `<irc-channel>` and after agent is joined send `auth <channel-secret>` message to authenticate yourself as an agent owner. Please replace `<irc-channel>` and `<channel-secret>` by your own values.

The full list of the `run.metta` optinos
| Option | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | `Anthropic`, `OpenAI` or `ASICloud` | The name of the LLM API provider. The corresponding API token should be exported as an environment variable (see the table above). Default value is `Anthropic` |
| `IRC_channel` | `"#some_channel_name"` | Name of the channel on [QuakeNet IRC server](https://webchat.quakenet.org/) which agent will connect to. In order to make agent talk only to the owner the `OMEGACLAW_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable is used. After agent is joined to the channel send `auth <secret>` message for the authentication. For example if `OMEGACLAW_AUTH_SECRET=12345` then one need sending `auth 12345`. |
| `embeddingprovider` | `Local` or `OpenAI` | The embedding provider to use for the memory. `Local` uses [sentence-transformers](https://pypi.org/project/sentence-transformers/) library locally. `OpenAI` requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` and uses OpenAI embedding API. |

OmegaClaw is an autonomous AI agent that is designed to independently set goals, make decisions, and take actions (including actions that the user did not specifically request or anticipate) and whose behavior is influenced by large language models provided by third parties, the outputs of which are inherently non-deterministic. Depending on its configuration and the permissions granted to it, OmegaClaw may execute operating-system shell commands, read, write, modify, or delete files, access network resources, send and receive messages through connected communication channels, and modify its own skills, memory, and operational logic at runtime. OmegaClaw may also be susceptible to prompt injection and other adversarial manipulation techniques whereby malicious content embedded in data sources consumed by the agent could influence its behavior in unintended ways. OmegaClaw supports third-party skills and extensions that have not necessarily been reviewed, audited, or endorsed by either of the Parties and that may introduce security vulnerabilities, cause data loss, or result in unintended behavior including data exfiltration. OmegaClaw relies on third-party services, including large language model providers, whose availability, accuracy, cost, and conduct are outside the control of the Parties and whose use is subject to their respective terms, conditions, and privacy policies. The user is solely responsible for configuring appropriate access controls, sandboxing, and permission boundaries, for monitoring, supervising, and constraining OmegaClaw's actions, for ensuring that no sensitive personal data is exposed to the agent without adequate safeguards, and for all actions taken by OmegaClaw on the user's systems or on the user's behalf, including communications sent and files modified.
